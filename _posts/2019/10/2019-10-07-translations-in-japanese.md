## Assembling a team of translators 

Recently, we came up with idea of translating software carpentry lessons in Japanese and have started looking for a team to help with this (see [link to post 1]() for details). The response in Japan has been incredibly supportive. We are still a small core team focusing on the translation of the lesson materials into Japanese but everyone has reached out to us has been enthusiastic and full of ideas. I met several other seasoned instructors in Yokohama through the Software Carpentry mailing list and the Tokyo R community. Members range from a student from my previous lab in New Zealand, to my new colleagues to another campus, to people I never would’ve met otherwise. We’ve held several meetings in Tokyo to discuss Software Carpentry. While we would like to have everyone involved online, the meetings have been good to troubleshoot problems submitting contributions on Github, to motivate everyone, and set deadlines to finish lessons.

As Japanese is very different to English, it has taken a long time to make progress with the translations. We did not expect it to be easy. Recently, we met to discuss our progress and we now have many translated lessons to review. We will check each other’s translations and give feedback before merging them into our repository. We are planning a “marathon” over weekends in summer where several translators will be active at the same time to help each other. Hopefully this will be good for motivation and avoid us repeating each other. We are already at least halfway through the R-gapminder lesson and expect a complete Japanese version in the near future. Progress has been slower on other lessons but we are considering a “sprint” format to break lessons into small chunks and translate together. We expect this to improve as we feel we are now in an exponential phase of community growth and engagement.

At the moment we are focused mainly on translating the lesson materials. However, we are interested in holding training events as well. We will be seeking support from local organisations as well as getting the advice of Tokyo R organisers on how they secure a venue. We are considering trying a small workshop taught in English first.
