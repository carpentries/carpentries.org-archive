## Translating Software Carpentry lessons into Japanese

A collaborative effort ot translate the core Software Carpentry lessons into Japanese is currently underway. Find out how we're managing translations on GitHub, what progress we've made, and what we've learned from it here. 

## Assembling a team of translators 

Recently, we came up with idea of translating Software Carpentry lessons in Japanese and have started looking for a team to help with this (see [our post on how we got started](2019-08-20-local-team-japan) for details on how to get involved). The response in Japan has been incredibly supportive. We are still a small core team focusing on the translation of the lesson materials into Japanese but everyone has reached out to us has been enthusiastic and full of ideas. Tom has met several other seasoned instructors in Yokohama through the Software Carpentry mailing list and the Tokyo R community. Our new members range from previous labmates in New Zealand, to my new colleagues to another campus, and people I never would’ve met otherwise. 

We’ve held several meetings in Tokyo to discuss Software Carpentry. While we would like to have everyone involved online, the meetings have been good to troubleshoot problems submitting contributions on Github, to motivate everyone, and set personal deadlines to finish lessons. Progress was slow to begin with since many of our volunteers are busy people who were not familiar with collaborating on GitHub but things have picked up recently. We expect this to improve as we feel we are now in an _exponential_ phase of community growth and engagement. This is largely due to feedback from the team and changes to how we communicate online and updates to the guides to make it easier for new translators to get involved.

## Translations as a collaboration

As Japanese is very different to English, the translations themselves have proven to be challenging and time consuming. We did not expect it to be easy. In particular, we are mindful to avoid more than one translator attempting the same section and we provide feedback by reviewing Pull Requests to our GitHub repository. We hope that this format will be compatible with a larger community maintaining and updating lessons in the future and that it could be useful for anyone considering translating the lessons into another language. We are still sorting out the details on how to merge these lessons with the Spanish and English versions and how to keep them up-to-date or versioned as a release.

Recently, we met to discuss our progress and we now have many translated lessons to review, especially for the R-novice-grapminder course. We will check each other’s translations and give feedback before merging them into our repository. We are currently running a “marathon” over weekends in summer where several of the core translators will be active at the same time to help each other. Hopefully this will be good for motivation and avoid us repeating each other. We are now well over halfway through the R-gapminder lesson and expect a complete Japanese version in the near future. We are finding it especially important to share Issues or Pull Requests early so that everyone is updated with what is already in-progress. Progress has been slower on other lessons but we are considering a “sprint” format to break lessons into small chunks and translate these together (rather than assigning entire lesson to each translator). In particular we are considering to attempt a sprint on the shell-novice lessons once the R lessons are completed and reviewed.

At the moment we are focused mainly on translating the lesson materials. However, we are interested in holding training events as well. We will be seeking support from local organisations as well as getting the advice of Tokyo R organisers on how they secure a venue. We are considering trying a small workshop taught in English first (as discussed [in our other post on](2019-08-20-local-team-japan)).
