Introducing Software Carpentry to Japan

There is a growing community that has embarked on a journey of culture clashes, finding missing grammatical particles, and figuring out what a submodule does. All with the goal of bringing bilingual software carpentry lessons in English and Japanese.

When Tom Kelly arrived in quiet Northern Japan 2 years ago, he did not expect to be in the thick of this. It’s been long adventure of trains in the wrong direction, skyscrapers with views from the bathrooms, and every flavour of ramen imaginable but Software Carpentry is coming to Japan. I’d started a new job in Yokohama and as often happens, they questions starting coming in on how to learn the shell and R and so on. I noticed that the website now hosted Spanish lessons as well as English. Having experienced culture clashes and language barriers myself, this was fantastic, I immediately asked myself could we do it in Japanese?

I found out that the Spanish team were considering a new workflow to track and update their translations so I pulled I forked a copy, tried adding a Japanese version of the git lesson, translated a few lines of the title page, and it worked! The developers didn’t understand a word of Japanese but were delighted the foriegn characters were supported. My Japanse was miserable and it would take me forever to translate anything. I had no idea what could translate literally and what you wouldn’t understand in such a different culture. Do the have a word of loop or is it “ru-pu’ from English? Do Japanese people even know who Dracula and Wolfman are? It would take a team effort. 

I needed help for translations and feedback on if this was a good idea. Would it even work in Japan? Plenty of people wanted to learn software tools but the format would be very different for people used to Japanese classrooms and studying for examinations. I’d attended the Tokyo R user group (#TokyoR) several times and been encouraged to give a presentation. They often explain basic topics and new packages to beginners (in Japanese) and some of them have written or translated R and Data Science books in Japanese and English. Software Carpentry was the perfect fit to share my experiences with the Research Bazaar in Australia and Software Carpentry workshops supported by the New Zealand eScience Infrastructure. So I shared what I learned from Software Carpentry as an Instructor, showed my demo for a webpage of a Japanese git lesson, and got a few laughs for Doraemon and Nobita documenting their space travels.


## Getting Involved in the Japanese Community

We welcome any support to grow The Carpentries community in Japan and abroad in the Japanese language. We are not yet ready to host a full workshop but welcome visitors to Japan with open arms, bows, and “omotenashi” (Japanese hospitality). If you can contact us ahead of 
time, we can let you know if any meet-ups are planned for when you are planning to visit. 

Support for the Japanese community from abroad is also welcome, several of our team are already based outside of the Kanto area, in other regions of Japan, the US, and New Zealand. While we have held meetings several times, we try to keep everyone updated online if they cannot attend due to their schedule or being unable to travel to Tokyo.

Any support for our efforts to translate the lessons into Japanese, maintain the translated lesson to keep them up-to-date, and to train instructors in Japan (or with Japanese language skills) will be appreciated. We hope to keep up our momentum to soon have an active community maintaining the lessons and using them with Japanese learners.

## What we need

At the moment our focus is on translating a full archived version of the core software carpentry lessons. Once this is complete, it will not be a trivial task to keep these maintained and up-to-date. We always welcome new translators to join to help in this effort and hope that it will become a community effor to maintain the Japanese version of lessons. We have set up guides to use the translation tools developed for Spanish lessons and tested these tools (see our github repo for further details). We welcome feedback on this as well as the accuracy of the translations. We have set up a wiki on this repository to share common terms to ensure consistency. We welcome feedback and discussions on whether anything needs to be adapted for participants with a different cultural background, we want participants to focus on learning to code and equip them with the terminology to find more information online, not have them grappling with idioms and unfamiliar examples.

In the future, we would be delighted to train new local instructors or hold workshops. At the moment we're considering testing a one-day workshop in English to try the Software Carpentry workshop format in Japan. We hope that this will be less of a commitment on everyone's busy schedules to try it out and give out translators experience as "helpers".

If you wish to support a workshop in Japan please contact us. We are particularly looking for support to run a workshop (venue, catering, ticketing, etc) and looking to grow the instructor pool in Japan. If you are a trained instructor based in Japan or visiting, please let us know! We also welcome any advice to train instructors in Japan online or with a train-the-trainer event.

## Find out more

If you wish to get involved in the translations, please find us on Twitter, join us on Slack and send pull requests to our lessons on GitHub. Please note that some translations are ongoing already and not all of them have been shared to GitHub yet (we’re working on this!). We welcome help from anyone but at this stage, please bear in mind that strong English and Japanese skills are needed for many aspects. If you are fluent in Japanese, please give us feedback on our translations. We will also appreciate advice on how to manage translations with PO files on GitHub, especially if you’ve tried this in another language.

Chat with the core team on the Tokyo.R [#swcarpentry](https://r-wakalang.herokuapp.com/) slack channel (日本語も大丈夫).

Anyone is welcome to contribute to Japanese lessons or join the core team. You do not need to be located in Japan but strong English and Japanese language skills will be helpful. See our Github repository<sup>[1](#i18n)</sup> for more details on how to contribute to translated lessons.
