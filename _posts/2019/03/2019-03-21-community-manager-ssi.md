The Carpentries activities in the UK
have been growing through our collaboration with the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://software.ac.uk/),
who pioneered Software Carpentry in Europe,
and other [Member Organisations](https://carpentries.org/members/).
The Software Sustainability Institute is now looking to [hire a Research Software Community Officer/Manager](https://software.ac.uk/blog/2019-03-19-were-hiring-research-software-community-officermanager)
to support their [Fellows community](https://software.ac.uk/about/fellows)
and events, e.g. [Collaborations Workshop](https://software.ac.uk/programmes-and-events/collaborations-workshops) and [CarpentryConnect](https://software.ac.uk/ccmcr19).
The recruit will join their team in Manchester, UK.

The Carpentries workshops are very popular among the Institute Fellows
as you can verify by watching some of the [2018 applications](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpX1jXuNTXGo2MYcFn68MI40Y6Kb2tWud).
Fellows' contribution to The Carpentries isn't limited to workshop organisation
but extends to lesson development and the creation of sister organisation,
e.g. [Library Carpentry was pionered by Fellow James Baker](https://software.ac.uk/blog/2017-02-24-library-carpentry-software-skills-workshops-librarians).
In this role,
you'll focus on develop communities of practice in the research software space
by nurturing the Institute Fellows
with the opportunity to work close with The Carpentries staff
as they nurture our global community.
