[We have learned](https://zenodo.org/record/1402200#.Xc780y3MxhF) Carpentries workshops have lasting positive impact on those who attend. Many of our learners attend multiple workshops, and have adopted behaviours as a result of completing our workshops, including using programming languages to automate repetitive tasks, sharing code or data publicly, and developing a data management and analysis plan.

To date, we have received 633 responses to our long-term impact survey between March 2017 and September 2019. We are officially opening our [Long-Term Impact Survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/carpentrieslongtermassessment) and would like anyone who has taken a Data, Software, or Library Carpentry workshop between April 2018 and December 2019 to share their story by completing the survey.

In the first quarter of 2020 we will be releasing learner assessment infographics. We cannot wait to hear about the lasting effect of our workshops, and any activities you have accomplished as a result of attending a Carpentries workshop. Weâ€™ll collect survey results until 20 December 2019.

Interested in our assessment resources? You will find all of our surveys and reports on the [assessment-repo](https://github.com/carpentries/assessment). [Get in touch](mailto:team@carpentries.org) to get involved with assessment at The Carpentries!
