We are pleased to announce that today, 18 November, we have [relaunched the main Carpentries website](https://carpentries.org/) and the three lesson program websites! All four websites have been redesigned to allow for integrated navigation between them, allowing the viewer to navigate to any other one of the websites from another. The URLs for the main Carpentries website, as well as the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/), [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/), and [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/) websites all remain the same. 

Recently, we outlined how [the websites were redesigned to provide an overview of The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/blog/2024/10/upcoming-website-and-handbooks-launch/), primarily for the general public, Carpentries member organisations, funders, and sponsors, as well as new members to the community or members who would like a refresher on The Carpentries’ core operations and community structure.   

To that end, the new websites are pared down to facilitate ease of navigation between the various pages, and we have removed all outdated or unnecessary repetition of information on the various pages. Resources irrelevant to the general public have been moved to The Carpentries Handbooks, which link from the main website.     

## Next up: Handbooks relaunch!

On 9 December, we will relaunch [The Carpentries Handbooks](https://docs.carpentries.org/) for Instructor Trainers, Instructors, Curriculum Advisors, Lesson Developers, Maintainers, Lesson Program Governors, and Community Session Hosts. These Handbooks will be accompanied by folders of curated resources, as with the websites, for ease of accessibility, but this time for our volunteer community to carry out their duties in collaboration. Unlike the website, the Handbooks contain detailed information for active volunteers in onboarded roles or for community members familiar with  The Carpenries’ operations. 

## Thank you to the Core Team and the community 
The new websites are the outcome of many years of contributions from The Carpentries Core Team, including our [legacy Core Team members](https://carpentries.org/blog/2024/01/with-gratitude-to-our-legacy-core-team-members/) who spent many hours deciding how to present the volumes of information about the organisation and our community in a way that best represents and serves the community and the general public interested in its activities. We are deeply grateful for their dedication and commitment, which has shaped a more accessible, informative, and welcoming online presence for The Carpentries organisation.
 
## Thank you to our funder
This project was funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation through Grant GBMF8628 to Community Initiatives (The Carpentries’ fiscal sponsor) to support the work of creating accessible resources to meet the needs and broaden engagement of The Carpentries’s diverse community of instructors and data scientists. 

## We welcome feedback
We are very proud of the work members of the Core Team have invested in the website update project,  but we wish to reiterate that the relaunched websites will continue to be works in progress. We hope you agree that the new websites (and Handbooks, when released) are a significant improvement from the old. We invite and are open to any feedback you may have as we continue to improve the sites. 

If you see something that is not working as it should or you have any other feedback or suggestions for us to consider, please submit an issue on GitHub directly from the resource or email us at [team@carpentries.org](mailto:team@carpentries.org). We would love to hear from you!
