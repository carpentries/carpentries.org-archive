The Subcommunity Spotlight Blog Series aims to raise awareness of subcommunities and their activities to facilitate connections among members who live in the same region or who live in another region and share a common language or interests with that subcommittee. The series is one of several activities developed in the Community Development Program to celebrate #Carpentries25, The Carpentries 25th anniversary. 

A subcommunity brings together a subset of the larger Carpentries. It can be local (e.g., University Carpentries Club), regional (e.g., The Carpentries in Africa), domain-specific (e.g., HPC Carpentry), or a group of community members sharing a common language (e.g., Carpentries-es) or interests (e.g., CarpentriesOffline). Subcommunities also include groups of individuals serving in the same community role within the organisation (e.g., Instructor Trainers, Maintainers).

To learn more about the program and to engage, we invite you to join the #community channel on Slack or our mailing [community@carpentries.org](mailto:community@carpentries.org). If you lead a Carpentries subcommunity and would be interested in being featured in a future post of this series, please contact us. 


## The Carpentries in Australia

The Carpentries in Australia is a regionally connected subcommunity for Carpentries activity in Australia, which often links their activities with the equivalent subcommunity in New Zealand. 

The Australian Research Data Commons coordinates a national Carpentries partnership, primarily focusing on supporting research trainers to become certified Carpentries Instructors. The Queensland Cyber Infrastructure Foundation (QCIF) runs most Carpentries workshops in Australia. The University of Technology Sydney and the University of Melbourne are also member organisations.
