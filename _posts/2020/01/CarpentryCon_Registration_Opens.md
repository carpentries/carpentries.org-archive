It is the year 2020 and we are swiftly approaching one of the biggest Carpentries events of the year…[CarpentryCon 2020](https://2020.carpentrycon.org/)! The Task Force is working vigorously to plan an exceptional event. To make this happen we need YOU! 

We cordially invite you to [register for CarpentryCon 2020](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/carpentrycon-2020-tickets-88906089507), June 29-July 1, 2020 at the [University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA](https://www.wisc.edu/)  where we will be *“Growing Inclusive, Computational Communities and Leaders”*.

The agenda will be filled with workshops, networking and community building. Attending this event will: 
be a great way to meet people in the community that you would normally see via Zoom
