A Member Organisation is an organisation which has made a commitment to the growth and spread of The Carpentries. Members receive priority access to [Instructor Training](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/) and guidance with capacity building at their organisation. With local Instructors, Member organisations can readily run low-cost local [workshops](/workshops/). Community-developed lessons enable our Instructors to globally share the effort for developing impactful lessons on technical topics. Memberships give The Carpentries revenue to ensure the ongoing development and maintenance of the lessons demanded by research communities. We also work to give your local Instructors support, mentorship, and a forum for community lesson development.

### Membership Tiers

We offer four tiers of Membership, based on the training and workshop activities expected annually. All fees listed are in USD and represent costs for not-for-profit organisations. Countries are grouped based on the Local Purchasing Power Index from [Numbeo][purchasing-power-index]. This scale is used to set membership pricing rates.  This is a part of our strategic plan to reduce barriers and create access for more organisations.  We also provide memberships for for-profit organisations. Please [contact us](mailto:membership@carpentries.org) for more information or pricing for for-profit organisations.

Regardless of the Purchasing Power group, we also offer financial assistance.  If you feel 
your organisation needs additional support, please [fill out this application](https://carpentries.typeform.com/to/k5u7wpuH).

### Platinum Memberships

The Platinum tier is our most customisable membership. The price of a Platinum membership 
depends on the number of  Instructor Training seats needed and the number of active Instructor 
Trainers at that site. All workshops are self-organised at this level. Centrally organised
workshops can be purchased at 50% of the a la Carte price.

Members of our team are on hand to support you in constructing a Platinum membership that
best suits your organisation's needs for training and community
development. To request a meeting with our team, [please send us an email](mailto:membership@carpentries.org).


<strong>Instructor Training</strong>  

Instructor Training is a primary benefit of membership. A Platinum membership may
include from 25 to 100 Instructor Training seats. Seats in Instructor Training are priced according to 
whether the training is coordinated by The Carpentries or internally by the member organisation. 

  * online, coordinated by The Carpentries: US$900 each
  * online with one in-house Instructor Trainer, coordinated by The Carpentries: US$700 each
  * online or in-person with two in-house Instructor Trainers, coordinated by member organisation: US$500 each

A Platinum membership must include a minimum of 25 Instructor Training seats. 

<strong>Instructor Trainer Training</strong>

Each year we provide training for a small number of qualified individuals to become Instructor Trainers. This training requires a significant time 
commitment and has limited availability. The cost to support an individual through this training is US$10,000. Each active Trainer at a member organisation
earns a US$5,000 discount on the membership price and can support in-house Instructor Training. An Instructor Trainer seat
generally pays for itself within two years. 

<strong>Workshops</strong>

Each Platinum membership includes unlimited self-organised workshops. Centrally organised workshops 
can be added to any membership for 50% of the A la Carte price

### Notes

Read more about how our workshops are run [here](/workshops/).

\* For Coordinated workshops, we will find instructors for the workshop, set up and handle registration, support instructor logistics and coordinate and share assessment results with the member organisation. A designated contact approves coordinated workshop requests for that organisation. Instructor travel expenses are the responsibility of the member and are not covered in membership fees.

\*\* For Self-Organised workshops, the organisation is responsible for finding local Instructors and handling the logistics of workshop coordination, including registration and registering the workshop with Software, Data, and Library Carpentry. As long at least one Instructor is Carpentries-certified, and either the Software, Data, or Library Carpentry content is fully taught, the workshop can be labeled a Carpentries workshop.

\*\*\* Any Instructor training includes the instructor mentorship and support of the Instructors through the Instructor development program.

^ In-person instructor trainings require an available Trainer and travel funds to support Instructor Trainers' travel.

We are always interested in new members, and in participating in grants and other proposals. To reach us, or to

We provide a limited number of sponsored memberships for institutions with financial need and for institutions serving historically underserved populations. If you believe that your institution is eligible for support, [please send us an email](mailto:membership@carpentries.org).
