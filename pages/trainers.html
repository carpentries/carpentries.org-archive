<p>
The Carpentries Trainer community comprises a group of experienced Instructors who inspire and prepare
the next wave of Instructors in our community. They work as a team to maintain and teach the
<a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/">instructor training curriculum</a> to
  prepare prospective Instructors to join The Carpentries community.</p>

Trainers can expect to acquire this <a href="https://github.com/carpentries/commons/blob/master/text-for-trainers.md">skill set</a>.
