The Carpentries workshops are taught by trained, peer, volunteer 
instructors. All of our Instructors complete an Instructor 
Training program, which teaches instructional pedagogy as well as the 
practicalities of teaching a Carpentries workshop.

Instructors can teach workshops in their local area or travel to
teach. We've held workshops in over 40 countries on every continent 
(including Antarctica). We match our Instructors with teaching 
opportunities that fit their schedules, travel interests, and 
availability.

There are two steps to becoming an Instructor.  

1. **Take the Instructor Training course**   
The training course runs over two full days and covers the basics of educational psychology, instructional design, and how to apply both to teaching workshops for The Carpentries. To see what our curriculum covers, visit the [instructor training course page](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/).

2. **Complete the checkout process**  
You must complete three short tasks after the course in order to complete certification. These [checkout tasks are described in detail on this page](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/) and take a total of approximately 8-10 hours. Once you've read the [detailed instructions, please use this page](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/) or our [simplified checklist](http://www.datacarpentry.org/checkout/) to keep track of your progress.

If you are interested in training multiple students or employees at your institution, consider becoming a [member organisation](https://carpentries.org/membership/)!

*Most of our Instructors are trained through organisational agreements with affiliated institutions. If you have been asked to provide information associated with this type of training, please apply using the button above. If you are not affiliated with one of our member organisations, we offer limited scholarships to attend online instructor training. Please fill out the form above to indicate your interest in participating in an upcoming instructor training.*

We are interested in instructors from all domains of research, and are particularly
working to grow our instructor pool in new geographies and in areas where we are developing [new curricula](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/#workshop-materials-under-development-or-consideration).
