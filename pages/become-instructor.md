The Carpentries workshops are taught by trained, volunteer Instructors. Instructor 
certification includes attendance at an Instructor Training event and three short 
“checkout” tasks. Together, these steps ensure that our Instructors are well 
grounded in principles of effective teaching, familiar with The Carpentries policies 
and practices, and are prepared to participate in and contribute to our community in the future. 
  
Carpentries Instructors can organise workshops at home or volunteer 
to join a workshop at another site through our centrally organised 
workshops program. We have held workshops in over 40 countries on 
every continent (including Antarctica!). We match our Instructors 
with teaching opportunities that fit their schedules, travel interests, and availability.

## Why Become an Instructor?
* To make your world better. By teaching their peers how to accomplish more with 
software and data skills, Carpentries Instructors are improving the environment 
that they themselves work in, clearing obstacles to their own success.
* To build a reputation. Teaching a workshop is a great way for people to introduce 
themselves to places they would eventually like to work, and a great way to make 
contact with potential collaborators around the world.
* To get practice teaching. Carpentries Instructors learn to implement 
evidence-based practices in a supportive, team environment. They also 
receive feedback through Carpentries surveys, creating a track record 
that can be useful in applications for teaching-related positions.
* To help get people of diverse backgrounds into the pipeline. Some of 
our Instructors are involved in part because they want computational science 
to include people from a broader range of backgrounds.
* To expand your technical skills. Carpentries Instructors continue to learn 
the very skills they teach, and more! Not only is teaching an excellent way to 
solidify existing skills, teaching with a team exposes you to new tips and tricks from others along the way.
* To acquire useful skills for all careers. Even “non-teaching” jobs demand skills 
that can be learned through teaching, especially as part of a team. You are 
welcome to borrow this wording to describe these skills in any professional context.
* To join a community of people who care about inclusive teaching of computational skills.
* Because it is fun. It really is!
  
## Steps to becoming an Instructor.
1. **Attend an Instructor Training event**
The training runs over two full days or four half days and covers the basics of educational psychology, evidence-based classroom practices, and how to apply both to teaching workshops for The Carpentries. For more details, visit the [Instructor training curriculum page](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/).
2. **Complete the checkout process**
You must complete three short tasks after the training in order to complete certification as a Carpentries Instructor. See our [Checkout Instructions](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/index.html) page for more details.  

## There are two ways to access Instructor Training: 

1\. **Get an access code from a Carpentries Member organisation or group that has arranged for training**

Member organisations have agreements with The Carpentries that include a specific number of Instructor Training seats. They select which trainees attend Instructor Training.  

If you have received an access code, you are ready to use your code to [sign up for an Instructor Training event](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/training_calendar.html)! When you register, you will also be asked to [create a profile in our database]({{site.instructor_training_app}}).
Where membership is not possible, The Carpentries occasionally sponsors groups for Instructor Training. At this time, applications for group sponsorship are available by invitation only. However, if you have a group that you believe will advance The Carpentries’ goal of reaching historically under-represented groups through sponsorship, you are welcome to [contact us](mailto:{{site.instructor_training_contact}}) with inquiries. 
For more information about membership and other options for group access to training, visit our [Membership page]({{site.url}}/membership/). 

2\. **Apply through the Open Instructor Training Program** 

The Open Instructor Training Program is a Carpentries-sponsored program in which individual applicants may be invited to receive training at no cost. Applications are scored and accepted on a rolling basis in order of scoring. This program is not for groups; multiple individuals from a single institution or cohort may be considered but will not be admitted simultaneously. [Apply to our Open Instructor Training Program]({{site.instructor_training_app}}).
