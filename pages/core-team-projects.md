Quarterly Projects were rolled out in the first quarter of 2019 as one of the strategies to help [The Core Team](ttps://carpentries.org/team) balance ongoing work with incoming projects and to make it easier to   plan, communicate and understand where time and resources are being prioritised.

To make sure work that is important, but not urgent, is prioritised and gets done, the core team continually focuses on planning out projects. Great books on project management abound, and we were fortunate to get some feedback from Melanie Nelson on project planning and management. Having tried the implementation of [shorter work cycles](https://datacarpentry.org/blog/2017/02/prometheus) in the past, we found we wanted more time for planning, feedback and wrap up. This is why we made the shift to quarterly work cycles in the first quarter of 2019, with four planning, doing, and wrapping up phases per year. 

You can read more about the thought process and rollout behind this current strategy [in this 2019 blog post](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/02/projects-teams-job-plans/).

## Executive Team 
<br/> 

Led by Kari L. Jordan, the Executive Team proactively brings together perspectives from all individual programmatic teams and established community segments. They discuss and resolve ongoing challenges, develop and implement a shared approach to management and leadership, review and make decisions on budget, oversee and make decisions on Core Team roles and responsibilities, establish and support how the Core Team works together, oversee project work, support the development of revenue opportunities including grants, and support the Executive Director in their work with the Executive Council.

#### Learner Survey Infographics

We collect information from our learners via the pre and post workshop survey. Additionally, we collected long-term impact survey responses in Q4 of 2020. We’ve released several reports using this data, however this year we will only create infographics with the data. This is because the results of our reports often say the same thing. In the future we may write a more comprehensive impact paper, but infographics that our team and community can use will be sufficient for this quarter.

#### The Carpentries Annual Report, 2019

In late 2018, [we released our first Annual Report (for 2018)](https://carpentries.org/blog/2018/10/annual-report/). This report has served as a valuable resource for communicating with both existing community members, as well as potential funders, Members, and others who we want to establish a relationship with. In Q1 2020, will develop 2019's annual report that both communicates updated metrics for our programs and financials, and also showcases the strengths of our organisation and how it has grown over the past year.

#### Planning for Implementing CoCc Task Force Recommendations 

A task force met four times during August and September 2019 to make recommendations to help respond to incidents that happen outside the existing mandate of the Carpentries Code of Conduct Committee. [These recommendations were released on 2019-09](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/09/cocc-taskforce-summary-recommendations/). This quarter we will develop a roadmap that can be used to implement the task force’s recommendations.

#### Recommendations for incidents outside the mandate of The Carpentries Code of Conduct committee 

With a growing community and an increasing number of Carpentries spaces (online and in-person), The Carpentries is encountering cases where a response to incidents either in or outside of Carpentries spaces may be appropriate, but are outside our formal guidelines and processes. Our Code of Conduct (CoC) and Code of Conduct Committee are now quite mature and in operation for incidents that fall within its mandate. There is less clarity when there are incidents outside the Code of Conduct committee’s current purview, including incidents that may have occurred outside of Carpentries spaces, incidents that happen within Carpentries spaces that are either not reported or are not yet incidents, or where people would like to share information or get feedback, rather than formally report an incident. These incidents may impact the ability of members to feel safe working in our community. We want to respond to these events in a timely manner and in a consistent way that balances transparency, confidentiality and legal considerations.

#### Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility Roadmap 

We currently employ a reactive approach to issues around equity, inclusion, and accessibility. Each process and program we as a team own - from how we collect information to how we support micro-communities - should include elements of a strategic plan that ensures we are advocating for community:

**Equity**: The creation of opportunities for equal access to and participation in programs that are capable of closing participation gaps in our community. <br/>
**Inclusion**: The active, intentional, and ongoing engagement of diverse people and communities that increases awareness, content knowledge, and empathic understanding of the ways we interact within (and change) our community.<br/>
**Accessibility**: Program/process design and implementation that offers multiple avenues for access and participation.

This project is being scoped to develop a strategic plan that will include our:
- **Strategy**: Scoping the larger vision for why we are doing this work.
- **Plan**: List of steps to accomplish the goals of our strategy.

#### Develop a System to Evaluate and Measure Project/Program Outcomes

Each staff team project will need sign-off from the Assessment and Equity and Inclusion Lead (Kari). We currently do not have a system to define what assessment/E&I looks like across projects and programmatic outcomes. The purpose of this project is to develop such a system in the form of a rubric and/or checklist.

## Business Team
<br/>Elizabeth Williams · Kari L. Jordan · Talisha Sutton-Kennedy 

Led by Elizabeth Williams, the Business Team works on the legal and financial aspects of our project and coordinates with our fiscal sponsor, Community Initiatives. Elizabeth Williams and her team members, Talisha Sutton-Kennedy and Kari L. Jordan, consistently evaluate and plan for our financial sustainability. Tracy Teal previously served on this team. Some of the projects the Business Team has embarked on since January 2019 include updating our grants collaboration workflow and producing a 2018 Annual Financial Report to support the Executive Council in strategic planning. More details about their quarterly projects is available below.

#### 2019 Financial Report

The conclusion of 2019, marked the end of our 2019 fiscal year, a new strategic plan and transitions within both our Executive Council and Executive Team. This annual report will outline the financial trends over the last year, our financial status at the end of the year, and provide an outlook going into 2020. Through this report, we hope to provide The Carpentries leadership (EC & Executive Team) the resources to make informed strategic financial decisions to support The Carpentries’ programs and to allow the broader community easy access to more detailed financial information

#### Grants to Support Program Development and Scaling

In November 2019, [we announced](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/11/czi-moore-grant/) that we have been awarded USD $2.65 million from Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to support our work over the next three years. This funding will support the growth of our Instructor Training program and Trainer Training programs, enable the creation of a platform for community members to share high-quality, peer-reviewed lesson materials (Carpentries Lab), move forward on our [Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility Roadmap](https://carpentries.org/files/assessment/equity_inclusion_accessibility_roadmap.pdf), more systematically support local community growth and leadership, and much more! For more information about the work these grants are supporting, see [our announcement](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/11/czi-moore-grant/). Also check out our [Supporters page](https://carpentries.org/supporters/) for more details on funding sources.

#### Growing our Core Team

At the end of Q3 2019, we bid [a bittersweet farewell to Chris Erdmann](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/09/thank-you-all/) as he moved on from his role as Library Carpentry Community & Development Director. This quarter, we [brought on-board Angelique van Rensburg](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/11/introducing-angelique/) as Regional Consultant for Southern Africa and [announced four new open positions](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/11/job-opportunities-with-the-carpentries) with our team. We also announced that our Executive Director, Tracy Teal, [will be moving on from her position](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/12/executive-director-transition) in January. We are grateful for Tracy’s transformative leadership and for Chris’s contributions to building the Library Carpentry community. In the new year, we look forward to finding our five new Core Team members. Will you be one of them?

#### Preparing to Report on our Programs

In 2018, [we released our first annual report](https://carpentries.org/blog/2018/10/annual-report/) as The Carpentries. We have also [released reports](https://carpentries.org/assessment/) on our [programmatic statistics](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2325620), and our impact on learners, both [immediately after workshops](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1043533) and [longer-term](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1039944). We also shared a high-level overview of our financials in [this blog post](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/05/carpentries-financial-updates/). It is important to us as an organisation, and in line with [our community value](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/11/carpentries-values/) of “Acting Openly”, to systematise our reporting process and make this information routinely available to the community in ways that are accessible and actionable. This quarter, we began to organise and clean our data to prepare for a Q1 2020 release of our 2019 Annual Report and financial report, as well as a report on our Instructor Training program, and a set of infographics around our impact on learners at our workshops. Watch our blog and [@thecarpentries](https://twitter.com/thecarpentries) on Twitter for announcements as these reports are released!

#### Financial Report, Budget Development and Tracking

In Q2, we generated a [Financial Report for fiscal year 2018](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/05/carpentries-financial-updates/). This report presents an overview of our income and expenses and serves as a resource to support our long-term financial sustainability. In order to sustain the financial health of The Carpentries as we grow and diversify, we have developed a quarterly budget creation and tracking system. This will allow us, as a community, to consider the financial impact of strategic decisions as we think about priorities and activities. 

In Q3 the Business Team has continued this work in cooperation with the Carpentries Executive Council Treasurer, Raniere Silva. We have created a Quarterly Budget format and workflow and will be working on integrating this into a Yearly Budget format and workflow for 2020.
</details>

<details>
<summary> 
<strong>April - June (Q2) 2019</strong>
</summary>
  This quarter (Q2 2019), the Business team focused on tracking and reporting our financial status and diversifying our income sources. In Q1 2019, we started organising and analysing the financial data we have for the year 2018, and we have now presented it as a report to the Executive Council, to give them a clear idea of our current financial trends and help them to make informed strategic decisions. Similarly, we will be developing a workflow to generate and track quarterly and yearly budgets. As our community grows and diversifies, so must our business practices, and developing a system for monitoring income and expenses will help us sustain financial health. 

  Based on information from 2018 on the growth of our activities, we will also be exploring individual donations and sponsorships as additional models for financial support. We currently have a donation button on our website, leading to a donation page that has been out of date and lacking in engagement. This page will be updated, so that donors have a clear understanding of the impact their donation will have. A Sponsorship Model Task Force will be assembled to explore a model for sponsorship with the community. We see a sponsorship model that invites sponsors to share the vision of our organisation as having potential for stable funding and partnerships.

#### Donate Button

As we work to diversify our revenue sources, we have made it easier for individuals to contribute financially to The Carpentries by updated the aesthetics and information on [donations page](https://carpentries.wedid.it/). Our websites and lesson pages experience high traffic volumes (the Data Carpentry R Ecology lesson receives more than 15,000 unique visitors per month!), so we wanted to offer those users an opportunity to donate to support our work by making the system easier to use and giving donors a clear idea of what their donations will serve. 

#### Sponsorship Model Task Force

In Q2, we assembled a [Sponsorship Model Task Force](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/07/sponsorship-programme/) to explore a model for sponsorship with the community. We see high potential for stable funding and partnership-building by developing a sponsorship model that invites mission-aligned organizations to share and support the vision of our organisation. This task force has begun to meet and outline work for piloting a sponsorship model in time for CarpentryCon 2020.

## Community Development Team
<br>Angelique van Rensburg · Kari L. Jordan · Serah Rono

Led by Serah Njambi Rono, the Community Development Team works to develop and maintain an open and welcoming community culture by supporting our various committees and task forces, and by introducing and running various initiatives that result in increased pathways for collaboration in our community, as well as equitable  distribution of resources, opportunities and access to inclusive spaces for our community members globally. Kari L. Jordan is a member of the Community Development Team, and we are currently recruiting for a Communications Manager. Chris Erdmann and Tracy Teal also served in this team. Some of the projects the Community Development Team has embarked on since January 2019 include:
developing and implementing a communications strategy for The Carpentries, updating our Code of Conduct documentation with the Code of Conduct Committee, The Carpentries Values Project, The Carpentries Tagathon, The Carpentries Gratitudes project among others. You can find more details about their quarterly project work below.

#### Developing a CarpentryConnect Planning Kit

CarpentryConnects are community convenings, organised to bring together community members of The Carpentries that are in close proximity geographically for knowledge exchange, collaboration and networking. As our community has grown in leaps and bounds over time, and these local and regional Carpentries events have become more popular in the last year, and because community members are solely responsible for the planning and execution of the events with minimal input from the Core Carpentries team, this project seeks to provide templates and resources that will serve as guides in planning and carrying out CarpentryConnect events. 
We hope to lower the barrier to entry in putting together these events, so community members feel empowered to organise for plenty of meetups that add value to their work, and want to uphold the quality of events that are run, given that they have The Carpentries name stamped on them.

#### The Carpentries Tagathon

In July, we systematised [our tagging system on The Carpentries blog](https://carpentries.org/posts-by-tags/) to improve the discoverability of our nearly 200 blog posts. Based on feedback from community members, in October, we extended this tagging system to the [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/blog/), [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/blog/), and [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/) blogs through a [Hacktoberfest Tagathon](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/10/carpentries-tagathon/). With fourteen years of posts on the [Software Carpentry blog](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/dates/), updating tags is a work-in-progress. We welcome your contributions to re-tagging our old posts at any time!

#### Expressing Gratitude To and From Our Community

Throughout the month of December, we are practicing [our community values](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/11/carpentries-values/) of “Valuing All Contributions” and “Community Collaboration” through our [Gratitudes Series](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/11/carpentries-gratitudes-series/). We extend heartfelt thanks to all of the individuals, committee and task force members, and all others who support The Carpentries mission. Read all of the messages of gratitude so far and watch the [green-stickies tag on our blog](https://carpentries.org/posts-by-tags/#blog-tag-green-stickies) for upcoming posts. If your task force or committee isn’t listed yet, and would like to add your message of gratitude, get in touch with us at [team@carpentries.org](mailto:team@carpentries.org).

#### Planning for CarpentryCon 2020

In 2018 we [held our first global Carpentries conference](https://carpentries.org/blog/2018/06/carpentry-con-report/) - CarpentryCon 2018 in Dublin, Ireland. Our community has also organised smaller, regional gatherings at [CarpentryConnect Davis](http://ivory.idyll.org/dibsi/CarpentryConWest.html), [CarpentryConnect Johannesburg](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/01/carpentryconnect-jhb2018/) and CarpentryConnect Manchester [1](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/07/ccmcr2019-highlights/) [2](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/09/carpentryconnect-manchester/). The CarpentryCon Task Force is now deep in preparations for [CarpentryCon 2020 in Madison, Wisconsin, USA](https://2020.carpentrycon.org/) and preparation has already begun for CarpentryCon 2021 in South Africa. The 2020 Task Force is currently accepting applications for financial aid](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/12/carpentrycon-financial-aid/) and [session proposals](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/11/carpentrycon2020-proposals/). For more information and important dates, head over to the [CarpentryCon 2020 website](https://2020.carpentrycon.org/). 

#### Carpentries Values

Shared values and goals have long been the starting point of communities of practice as they identify changes they want to see and start working together towards these changes. Between July and November 2019, The Carpentries Community Development Team formed a Task Force which [worked with our community](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/09/carpentries-values-update-and-question-three/) to identify and articulate [The Carpentries Values](https://carpentries.org/values/). A long-form report detailing why and how this work was done [can be found here](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces/blob/master/2019/articulating-the-carpentries-values/2019-11-carpentries-values-summary.md).

<strong>July - September (Q3) 2019</strong>
</summary>

#### Communications Strategy and Implementation Plan

As you may remember, [we developed our community communications strategy in Q1](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/04/how-and-why-we-communicate/), an exercise that allowed us to define our goals around use of our communications platforms, outline the audiences we communicate to, and integrate inclusivity practices for all communications on The Carpentries channels. [We then started implementing it across our platforms and resources in Q2](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/07/carpentries-comms-strategy/) and have continued with this implementation work in Q3. One of our primary goals for this year is to empower our community members to document and share their knowledge and experiences on our community blog, YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/thecarpentries) and other community spaces. Our [communications “how-to” guides](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/guides/index.html) in our handbook are one primary tool we are currently using to achieve this, so have a read and let us know what other guides you would like The Carpentries team to make available for you.  

#### The Carpentries Values

As our community coalesces into a shared identity as “The Carpentries”, defining our core values is a priority. Our community values shape everything from the ways that we communicate, to the work that we take on, to the funding opportunities we pursue. [Feedback from our community members](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/09/carpentries-values-update-and-question-three/) has been, and will continue to be, vital in articulating these values. We are looking forward to continuing these conversations and formulating these values with our community in Q4 and beyond. For everyone who has interacted / collaborated with members of The Carpentries community in workshops, conferences or across different initiatives, take a few minutes to answer three questions via [GitHub](https://github.com/carpentries/conversations/issues/21), [our community Discussion channel](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss/T9029fc4692993ab1/input-needed-help-us-articulate-the-carpentries-values) or anonymously via [this Google Form](https://forms.gle/gZmafyLVKAHBqfgc6).

<strong>April - June (Q2) 2019</strong>
</summary>
  In the first quarter of 2019, we assessed all of The Carpentries communications channels, requested for input from the broader Carpentries community,  and developed a communications strategy to help define [how and why we communicate as a team at The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/04/how-and-why-we-communicate/). The strategy includes measures to create awareness about the work that we do, encourage participation and collaboration, and empower and edify our community. But we are also convinced that a strategy is not sufficient in and of itself. Implementation is an important subsequent step. 

  While implementing the strategy is a continuous task that we hope to carve out into all aspects of our communication over time, in Q2 2019, the Community Development team is test driving the new strategy by:
  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
  <li>reviewing, refining and standardising content in existing community-facing resources on our website, in our Handbook, YouTube channel and other persistent sources that our community references regularly. </li>

  <li>working with other staff teams to incorporate the communications strategy into their regular and quarterly project work i.e. by identifying specific audiences that each project is geared at, we can identify channels where these communities thrive, and ways to engage them meaningfully over time</li>

  <li>being more present and active in environments our community meets and collaborates in so we can learn from you, and understand how to help initiate new collaborations, rally others to participate in ongoing ones and sustain existing ones as community needs evolve over time. For example,</li>
   <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
    <li>we hosted Community Discussions on 21-22 May (<a href ="https://youtu.be/npJcMKUKVwc">view recording</a>) and learnt so much from you on paths to consider <a href = "https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/05/equity-inclusion-accessibility-roadmap/">as we work on our Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility Roadmap</a>. </li>

    <li>From our monthly Carpentries Instructors in Africa call, community members were really drawn to Bianca’s and Katrin’s creative ideas for teaching R workshops, and they agreed to collaborate on this informative blog post - <a href="https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/05/R-tips-and-tricks/">Tips and Tricks for Teaching R</a>. We are keen to receive more posts by the community for The Carpentries blog, and anyone interested in submitting a draft can <a href="https://forms.gle/dssvVNMqPrTQ3Ljs9">fill out this form</a> or <a href ="mailto:serah@carpentries.org">send it to Serah Rono</a> directly.</li>

    <li>we were at <a href ="https://csvconf.com">CSV Conference</a> in early May 2019 and met lots of researchers, librarians and technologists there, some of whom will be facilitating our themed community discussions, also known as Carpentries Conversations, in the coming months. Look out for that. We’re also very excited to be attending <a href ="https://www.software.ac.uk/programmes-and-events/carpentryconnect">CarpentryConnect in Manchester</a> in June 2019, and Serah Rono will co-chair the Open Source communities track at <a href ="https://www.scipy2019.scipy.org">SciPy 2019</a> in Austin, Texas in July 2019. We look forward to meeting some of our community in person at these events!</li>

## Curriculum Team
<br/>Erin Becker · François Michonneau

Led by Erin Becker, the Curriculum Team guides and oversees curriculum development and maintenance and works closely with our Maintainer community and Curriculum Advisor committees. François Michonneau is a member of the Curriculum Team. Some of the projects the Curriculum Team has embarked on since January 2019 include: updating the format of Maintainer meetings, producing a first draft of a Curriculum Development Handbook, working with the Genomics R Maintainers to make progress towards publishing a lesson for working with Genomics data in R, working with the Maintainers group to develop a prototype for our new lesson template, and working with the Library Carpentry Maintainers and Curriculum Advisors to continue to develop Library Carpentry’s curricula. You can find more details about their quarterly projects work below.

#### Image Analysis Curriculum Beta Release

Data Carpentry’s Image Analysis curriculum has started piloting with Instructors who are not the original lesson authors. In Q1 2020, we hope to publish it on Zenodo, add it to our lesson page, and announce it to the community as a “BETA” lesson. Beta lessons are NOT available upon request (i.e. through the workshop request form), but are considered stable enough for experienced Instructors to teach in self-organised workshops.

#### New Data Carpentry Lessons Being Piloted

With [funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://datacarpentry.org/blog/2018/02/curriculum-dev-scaling), The Carpentries Curriculum Team has been working with community collaborators to develop curricula for Economics and Image Analysis. This quarter, Constantin Pape and Dominik Kutra at EMBL, Germany have updated the [Image Analysis lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/image-processing/), authored by Dr. Tessa Durham Brooks and Dr. Mark Meysenburg at Doane College, Nebraska, USA. This update was focused on converting the lesson from one Python library to another that is easier to install and has better documentation - reducing cognitive load for learners. The updated materials are being piloted at EMBL and the University of Arizona in early 2020 and are scheduled for a beta release in Q1 2020. A new curriculum for Economics, teaching [Stata](https://github.com/datacarpentry/stata-economics) and the [bash shell](https://github.com/datacarpentry/shell-economics) is currently in alpha and is targeted for a beta release in mid 2020.  

#### Maintainer Onboarding Program Coming Soon

Members of our Maintainers community are currently planning a reboot of our Maintainer Onboarding program. This program will help ensure new Maintainers are supported in learning the technical and social aspects of maintaining lessons, and will also provide support to existing Maintainers who joined the team before onboarding was available. Onboarding will first be offered to existing Maintainers, with a second round of onboarding for new Maintainers in Q2 2020. For more information, see [this discussion on the Maintainers RFC repo](https://github.com/carpentries/maintainer-RFCs/issues/8).

#### Carpentries Incubator Launch

With so many members of our community excited about creating and sharing Carpentries-style lesson, we have launched The Carpentries Incubator as a place to share Carpentries-style teaching materials at all stages of development, to collaborate on lesson development, and receive feedback from other community members. Incubator lessons are developed and supported by community members and are not officially endorsed by The Carpentries. We encourage you to [browse the Incubator lessons](https://carpentries.org/community-lessons/) for materials that meet your needs and to use these materials freely. However, we are unable to offer workshops teaching these lessons upon request. In Q1-Q2 2020, we are hiring two new Core Team members to focus on developing a CarpentriesLab platform for sharing high-quality open source curricula and creating infrastructure, documentation, and community engagement pathways for people to contribute curricula to a shared repository for dissemination and discovery.

### Curriculum Development Handbook

At the end of Q1, [we announced](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/04/curriculum-development-handbook/) the creation of our [Curriculum Development Handbook (CDH)](https://cdh.carpentries.org). The CDH serves as a stand-alone reference manual for folks developing lessons using our [lesson template](https://github.com/carpentries/lesson-example) in line with The Carpentries community values and educational philosophy. We’ve now advanced work on this handbook to include information on [community development roles](https://cdh.carpentries.org/community-development-roles.html) and the [lesson life cycle](https://cdh.carpentries.org/the-lesson-life-cycle.html). This continues to be a work in progress and contributions as issues or pull requests on [this project’s GitHub repository](https://github.com/carpentries/curriculum-development) are very welcome! This quarter has also seen the launch of [The Carpentries Incubator](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/proposals) as a central location for sharing open-source lesson materials and collaborating on new curricular development. 

#### Genomics Curriculum Relaunch

Data Carpentry’s [Genomics workshop](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-workshop/) teaches researchers how to manage their data, access data from popular sequencing databases, automate their analysis pipelines by writing custom Bash scripts, and compute in the cloud. Genomics is a fast-moving field, and starting in August 2017, Instructors began to advocate for updating both the data set and software used, to modernise this workshop and keep it relevant. Over a 22 month period, hundreds of Instructors, helpers, learners, Maintainers, Curriculum Advisors, and others contributed to this major curriculum update and [publication](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/07/lesson-release/). Read our [blog post](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/07/genomics-relaunch/) for more details and to get involved in teaching or hosting this workshop!

#### Lesson Release

Thanks to the more than 1100 of you who contributed, twenty-seven Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry and Software Carpentry lessons were [successfully released](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/07/lesson-release/) on Zenodo this June. Publication provides contributors with a citable work product, and helps us recognise the work our community members do to keep our lessons healthy. If you don’t see yourself listed as an author for a lesson you contributed to, please let us know by contacting [team@carpentries.org](mailto: team@carpentries.org) so we can give you credit for your work. 

#### Image Analysis Curriculum

With [funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://datacarpentry.org/blog/2018/02/curriculum-dev-scaling) and the NSF, Data Carpentry has been collaborating with Dr. Tessa Durham Brooks and Dr. Mark Meysenburg at Doane College, Nebraska, USA to develop new lessons in image processing. Drs. Durham Brooks and Meysenburg have piloted this workshop at Doane and are now working with Constantin Pape and Dominik Kutra at EMBL, Germany, to translate the materials to a different Python library, based on pilot feedback. This lesson is considered to be in alpha stage and is cannot be requested as a centrally-organised Data Carpentry workshop, but community members are encouraged to work through the material and provide [feedback on its GitHub repository](https://datacarpentry.org/image-processing/). We anticipate a beta-release and pilot workshops at multiple institutions in early 2020.

#### Economics Curriculum

In addition to the Image Analysis curriculum work discussed above, our grant from The Alfred P. Sloane foundation also focused on development of a new Data Carpentry curriculum for Economics. We have been working with Dr. Miklos Koren at Central European University to draft these lessons, and have piloted one lesson at the European Economics Association Congress in Manchester in August. If you are interested in following or being involved in development of this curriculum, please visit the associated GitHub repositories for the [Stata](https://github.com/datacarpentry/stata-economics) and [bash shell](https://github.com/datacarpentry/shell-economics) lessons.

  In the first quarter of 2019, the Curriculum Team worked with Maintainers of the [Data Analysis and Visualisation in R for Genomics lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-r-intro/) to complete an alpha version of that lesson. Jason Williams and Uwe Hillgert are hosting a pilot workshop using this lesson at the University of Arizona, along with a [BugBBQ hacky day](https://datacarpentry.org/blog/2019/05/genomics-pilot) to catalyse community work on the Genomics lessons and prepare for publication in June. Thirty-six of The Carpentries lessons are planning to be involved in the June release. Maintainers for those lessons welcome community contributions. [Read the blog post](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/05/lesson-release/) to see how you can get involved! 

  The Curriculum Team also developed an initial draft of a [Curriculum Development Handbook](https://carpentries.github.io/curriculum-development/), which is now being used by Miklos Koren of Central European University to develop a Data Carpentry curriculum for [economics researchers](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#economics-curriculum). This team is also working with Tessa Durham Brooks and Mark Meysenburg at Doane College, Nebraska, USA to pilot a workshop for [image analysis](https://datacarpentry.org/image-processing/). 

  In late May, The Carpentries will begin spreading the word about our updated Genomics curriculum to member institutions and other groups. We are excited to offer more opportunities for Instructors to teach these lessons and will be offering a one-hour webinar starting in June, which will be recorded and offered through [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBOUNBBZxc4DML3F89cEvGA). If you’d like to be notified when the webinar is available, please [add your email address here](https://forms.gle/ubxK9bApRub62vUE8). We will be announcing opportunities to teach these lessons through the [Instructors TopicBox list](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/instructors), so make sure you’re signed up to receive these messages! If you’re excited and want to start exploring the curriculum now, you can access all the lessons from the [Genomics workshop homepage](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#genomics-workshop) and can get information on how to launch your own [AWS EC2 instance](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-workshop/AMI-setup/index.html) to explore the materials.

## Infrastructure Team
<br>François Michonneau · Maneesha Sane 

Led by François Michonneau, the Infrastructure Team is behind all of the systems that keep our organisation running (including Etherpads, lesson templates, database management and more!). Maneesha Sane is a member of the Infrastructure Team. Tracy Teal previously served in this team. Some of the projects the Infrastructure Team has embarked on since January 2019 include: organising and documenting our infrastructure systems, and migrating our surveys from SurveyMonkey to Typeform. You can find more details about their quarterly projects work below.

#### Automating Routine Emails for Workshops

In Q1 2020, we will work closely with the Workshops Administration team to actualise a priority they identified as part of their Q3 2019 work - email automation for routine emails at predicted times or triggers related to workshop coordination.

#### Scaling Up Instructor Training

Our Instructor Training program is growing rapidly and continued growth is expected in the coming months. To be ready for this growth, in Q1 2020, the infrastructure team will work closely with the Instructor Training team to analyse our existing systems, identify areas where processes could be streamlined or automated, and implement these new procedures.

#### Workshop Surveys

In October, we [rolled out an update](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/10/transition-to-typeform/) to our pre- and post-workshop surveys that provides a more intuitive and (hopefully) a better overall experience for both learners and Instructors. Learners can now complete the surveys more quickly, and Instructors now receive a clearer and more actionable overview of their learners’ survey responses. With this new system, we can customise the way results are presented to ensure they are maximally useful for Instructors. If you check your survey results and find yourself thinking “I would really like to see things visualised this way instead” please [get in touch](mailto:francois@carpentries.org)! We’re also seeking a community member to review the code used to generate these reports, as we prepare to open-source this code as a Shiny app. Please [contact François](mailto:francois@carpentries.org) if you’re interested. For any other questions about this new system, please contact [team@carpentries.org](mailto:team@carpentries.org).

<strong>July - September (Q3) 2019</strong>
</summary>

#### Infrastructure Documentation and Systems

We continued improving documentation and management of our infrastructure systems. We’ve cleaned up and systematised repository access across our 50+ lesson repos, and have created Maintainer [teams in GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-teams) to make permissions easier to keep up to date moving forward. These teams also provide opportunities for Maintainers to use GitHub’s team-based communication features. 

We’ve put a system in place for management and development of AMY, our internal database. AMY is where we manage data on instructor certification, workshops, instructor training events, memberships, and more and is central to the work of many of our staff team members. By systematising how we handle bug fixes, prioritise enhancements to existing features, and implement new feature requests, we can optimise developer time and ensure this work best supports our communities needs. 

#### Survey Migration to Typeform

Until recently, all of our pre- and post-workshop surveys have been hosted on SurveyMonkey. As our community grows, we have developed new needs for survey hosting and data storage. We began to investigate Typeform as an alternative survey platform in early 2019 and piloted it with a few workshops. Feedback from instructors was very positive and Typeform makes it easier to develop custom workflow with the data collected. Transitioning to Typeform was also a good opportunity to revamp how results from the pre- and post-workshop surveys are presented to instructors (see below).

#### Instructor-focused Reports from Workshop Survey Feedback

A core value of our community is continued improvement through feedback. Learners at our workshops complete pre- and post-workshop surveys. That data is used to inform [our overall assessment](https://zenodo.org/record/1325464#.XXmD4ZNKiv6) and is also made available to individual Instructors for their workshops. The format of the survey results output from SurveyMonkey, however, is not easy to interpret and act upon. Our goal is to make it easier for Instructors to review feedback from their learners and make actionable changes in their teaching (and also to know what worked well!). We’ve been working to create an Instructor-focused survey results format, which will present this information to Instructors in a clear way.  In Q3, we have developed the infrastructure needed to provide a website that will present the results of the surveys to the instructors. We plan to roll out this new system to all our workshops in Q4, and extend it to instructor training events in early 2020.

#### Lesson Program Website Template

As each our our lesson programs (Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, and Software Carpentry) have grown, so have their websites, driven by a team of dedicated community. This growth has meant that the websites have developed inconsistent structures, often making it difficult for new and veteran community members alike to find the information they are looking for. In Q3, we began developing a standard template for all three lesson program websites, to ensure they all have the same navigation and site map, and only contain lesson program specific content.  All other content will be directed to The Carpentries website and handbook. A small group of community members has provided feedback on the redesign. In future quarters, we will be developing a remote theme based on this design. The three lesson program sites (and any new lesson program site) will connect to this theme, ensuring we maintain a consistent structure as we continue to grow.

<strong>April - June (Q2) 2019</strong>
</summary>

  2018 was spent transitioning from the separate identities of Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry to a unified identity of “The Carpentries”, welcoming in Library Carpentry as an official lesson program, and transitioning to Community Initiatives as our fiscal sponsor.  We spent the early part of 2019 ensuring this new identity is reflected across all our platforms (front facing and back end).  This included things like updating documentation across all four websites, The Carpentries Handbook, lesson templates and other materials, and we’re continuing this work in the second quarter of 2019.  

  For Q2 our projects include updating the workshop surveys to use a more flexible and robust backend data structure, and more relevant presentation of the results for instructors. We have also heard that people are using Carpentries lessons outside our workshops, and that they are looking for ways to contribute to sustain our organisation. For instance, the Data Carpentry R Ecology lesson receives more than 15,000 unique visitors per month! We’re evaluating having an unobtrusive ‘Donate’ button on the lesson, to see if it’s a way people want to support our work. 

  Each quarter, we will also be supporting all the other teams in their infrastructure, technology, and documentation  needs.  This includes ensuring documentation for new projects is up to date, and new projects are supported in evaluating and implementing new tools (web services, databases, etc.)

#### Instructor Training Report

We are going to be scaling up our Instructor Training program by 30-50% in the next three years. We need to figure out what that entails, in terms of resource allocation and which parts in our process are inefficient. In Q1 2020, we will be looking into trends in Instructor, trainee, and applicant diversity based on past program decisions, and develop clear preliminary benchmark(s) of quality that we can track as we make changes, among other things. Our findings will be shared in our Instructor Training report.

#### Training New Instructor Trainers

In November 2019, we [opened applications](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/11/trainer-training-2019/) for our next round of Instructor Trainer Training. We focused on supporting current Instructor Trainers (by reserving seats for applicants where we currently have a single Trainer) and recruiting regional or institutional pioneers (by reserving seats for pairs of applicants in regions or at institutions with no existing Trainers). We also considered applications from individuals who didn’t fall into these two groups, to onboard amazing new Trainers regardless of their location. We received 43 applications, and unfortunately were only able to accept 14 applicants into this cohort. These Trainer trainees will go through a 3-month onboarding and join our existing 75 member-strong Trainer team in mid-Q2 2020. As we hire our new [Deputy Director of Instructor Training](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/11/job-opportunities-with-the-carpentries/), we look forward to expanding our capacity for training new Trainers and bringing more of our amazing applicants onto the team!

#### Instructor Trainer Recruitment and Alumni Program

[Our Trainers](https://carpentries.org/trainers/) teach Instructor Training, lead teaching demonstrations, and support continued improvement of our Instructor Training curriculum. This community has grown from **one member** in 2012 (Greg Wilson) to nearly eighty in 2019. Community members become Trainers through our Trainer Training program, an 8-week course covering pedagogy and Carpentries practices. 

We have not yet had a formal recruitment strategy for this program, leading to unbalanced geographical growth of this community. This project was initially conceived to create such a strategy, to help make Trainer recruitment more intentional and transparent. Following discussions with members of the staff Leadership and Membership Teams,  we determined that we have enough Trainers to meet our projected capacity needs and [don’t need to run another Trainer Training in this calendar year](https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/09/September-Trainer-Training-Postponement/). 

However, it has become clear that the number of certified Trainers doesn’t give a full picture of our capacity. Changing careers and lives mean that the availability of our Trainer community-members to participate in training events and other community responsibilities can also change, and our program had no way to account for or embrace those changes. With feedback from the Trainer community, we have developed a Trainer Alumni Program to enable Trainers to take a planned leave of absence. With this program, we will now have a more accurate estimate of our capacity for Instructor Training, and Trainers will have a guilt-free opportunity to take a break or step down from Trainer duties. Twelve (14%) Trainers have transitioned to an Alumni role, with the remaining 76 reaffirming their commitment and availability to support Instructor Training through September 2020. We look forward to welcoming a new class of Trainers early next year. Please expect a call for applications in November 2019!

#### Teaching Demonstration Scheduling

In January, we increased the number of teaching demonstration sessions we ran to make it easier for Instructor trainees to complete their checkout. However, we found Trainer availability doesn’t follow a specific pattern, leaving many demo sessions without hosts. This placed a burden on trainees, when demos were cancelled, and also on a few highly-engaged Trainers and staff, who often hosted at the last minute. We’ve now changed the way we schedule demos, allowing Trainers to choose any time that fits their schedule (rather than from a collection of repeating time slots). This has the added benefit of distributing sessions over a wider set of times, making it easier for trainees to find a time that works for them. With this new system, Trainers have met or exceeded our 12 sessions per month goal for every month from August through October!

<summary>
<strong>April - June (Q2) 2019</strong>
</summary>
  In the first quarter of 2019, we addressed the fact that we had no existing workflow to handle “odd cases” of instructor training requests. While these are largely run in the context of membership, there are occasional events where our membership model does not fit well. There are also sometimes questions about whether additional seats can be added to existing in-person instructor training events. We now have a workflow to handle these occasional requests and assign charges or scholarships in each case. We still expect most events to be arranged through membership, but anyone with a request that doesn’t fit can now contact Karen to get the ball rolling. We learned a lot about the needs of our community in developing this process, and have been gratified to learn that people are pleased to have a pathway to accomplish their training goals.

  For Q2, we will be reviewing and recommending improvements to our procedures for recruiting and selecting Instructor Trainers. Our Trainer community is a powerful force in setting the tone and direction of The Carpentries as a whole -- they train our Instructors! In the past, our process for recruitment and selection has been successful in recruiting amazing and dedicated Trainers, but in the absence of explicit structure it has also been confusing and opaque. This is an entirely new project, which will take the long view on strategic planning for The Carpentries, with the aim of creating a process that is transparent, fair, equitable, and effective in recruiting trainees who are enthusiastic about our mission and empowered to carry it forward. We anticipate rolling out our next call for Instructor Trainer recruitment in September-November of 2019, so the broader community and interested applicants can look forward to learning more about our new and improved processes at that time!

#### Developing Data Savvy Librarians in California

We have identified a need for  data and computational training among academic librarians throughout California. While the goal of Library Carpentry is to provide this training, outside of a few Carpentries-heavy institutions, there is currently little awareness of The Carpentries or the training the organisation provides. Led by Ariel Deardorff, we hope to pilot new consortial models of Carpentries Membership to develop sustainable Carpentries communities throughout California that increase the state’s capacity to offer training in data and software skills to librarians through this project from Q1 2020. If successful, these models will be expanded to other kinds of library communities in a variety of institutional environments as well as to other regions outside of California. More details about this can be found [in Ariel's January 2020 blog post](https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/01/library-carpentry-announcement/).

#### Member Survey and Member Organisation Council

In October and November, [we shared our 2019 Membership Survey data](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/10/membership-survey/) and held Member Organisation Council discussions around these survey responses. Our primary goal for this survey was to identify what could be added to and improved about Carpentries Membership to better align with the growing and diversifying needs and goals of local communities everywhere. Members identified as priorities: support in building and sustaining their local communities, increased support for Instructors and learners, pathways for curriculum development, and a more varied membership model. Our [grant funding from Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative] directly supports the first three of these goals, and indirectly provides more Core Team time for expanding our membership model. We are excited to continue working with our Member Organisation Council, and community leaders, in building a robust and varied membership program to support our diverse communities.

#### Member Organisation Council Meeting and Survey

We held another set of Member Organisation Council Meetings the week of June 17th. There were five meetings that brought together folks building Carpentries communities at their organisations through memberships. The meeting included general discussion on the topic of ‘Managing the Overhead of Membership, Capacity and Community Building’ to share tips, solutions and challenges around building and sustaining local communities. We remain excited about the ability of these meetings to bring member organisation representatives from around the world together to share ideas. We were also able to share some preliminary results from our [2019 Member Organisation Survey](https://carpentries.typeform.com/to/hjtqBI) at the meetings. This survey focused on the goals different organisations have for membership and the areas of membership we could develop to help attain those goals. So far, we can see that there is enthusiasm for exploring the addition of curriculum development, community building resources, and learner support to our membership program. We would like to gather more input from member organisation representatives [through this survey](https://carpentries.typeform.com/to/hjtqBI) and are excited to discuss the results in the next Member Organisation Council meeting. With community and staff input, we can determine the additions and improvements that should be prioritised for maximum impact across Member Organisations.

In our last Council meeting at the end of 2018, members expressed interest in quarterly meetings, and we are excited to kick them off in this quarter. In the Member Organisation Survey, we will be seeking feedback on Member Organisations’ goals for membership and additions and improvements we could make to help the Membership Program better align with these goals.

#### Automating Routine Emails for Workshops

There are several tasks to be completed to successfully plan one workshop. In Q1 2019, we identified a variety of different things we can automate or streamline within AMY to improve the workshop/instructor training coordinator experience, reduce the time it takes to coordinate a workshop or instructor training event, increase reliability of information going to instructors and better collect and track data. In Q1 2020, we will work on a priority we identified in Q1 2019 - email automation for routine emails at predicted times or triggers related to workshop coordination.

#### CarpentryCon2020 Sponsorship Program Pilot

The Sponsorship Exploration Task Force (SEFT) ([link to charter](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces/blob/master/2019/sponsorship-exploration/sponsorship-exploration-project-charter.md)) has been evaluating The Carpentries approach to Sponsorship and the CarpentryCon 2020 Budget Subcommittee has been developing a model for sponsorship for CarpentryCon 2020. While, overall the Task Force is thinking about Sponsorship for The Carpentries organisation, the Task Force has agreed that rather than starting with organisational sponsorship, we should pilot a sponsorship approach for CarpentryCon 2020. In Q1 2020, we will develop a model to be used for future CarpentryCon events.

#### Automating Routine Emails for Workshops

If you have organised a Carpentries workshop, you know that there are a *lot* of emails sent as part of this process! Until now, all of those emails have needed to be sent manually, either by the lead instructor, host, or a workshop administrator. This quarter, we have been working on adding functionality to our workshop infrastructure to make it possible to send out these emails automatically. This will reduce administrative burden, enabling us to organise more workshops, and leaving more time for answering your questions about workshops and supporting you with your individual needs. We are planning on piloting email automation with a small group of workshops in early 2020. Please get in touch if you are interested in having your workshop be a part of the pilot!

In Q2 and Q3, we have [redesigned our workshop request form!](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/08/workshop-request-form-updates-teaser/). Our old form was unwieldy, providing a single point of input to serve at least three distinct needs:

* workshop request
* reporting self-organised workshop
* request for workshop consult and info 

This meant users had to answer a number of questions that weren’t relevant to them, and also made form responses more difficult to process on the back-end. We’ve separated out these three use cases, reducing the number of questions users will see, while keeping everything centralised with [a single landing page](http://carpentries.org/request-workshop). As part of this project, we’ve also updated our [workshops page](https://carpentries.org/workshops/) and begun a pilot to track (and give our Instructors credit for!) non-standard workshops. We are very excited to have these changes go live, and are now moving on to other projects focused on improving our community’s experience around workshops.

<strong>April - June (Q2) 2019</strong>
</summary>

  In the first quarter of 2019, the Workshop Administration team, including the [Regional Coordinators](https://carpentries.org/regionalcoordinators/), developed a [list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e62jof6IgIu6Y-2sz2jZmb_ayLJVOU_UxihEiKZOnSs/edit#gid=0) of all of the tasks that they would like to have automated. We feel strongly about the need for continued human interaction with the community, so our list also includes tasks that should not be automated. In addition to creating the list, we ranked our ideas in order of priority. We then worked with the Infrastructure team to review these two lists and decided on items to be automated in Q2. 

  In Q2, the Workshop Administration team will work with the Infrastructure, Membership and Community Development teams to update the Workshop Request Form. Currently, the [single form](https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/workshop/) is used to notify us of centrally-organised workshops, self-organised workshops and inquiries. To ensure that The Carpentries Staff captures the information needed and the Requester/Informer fills out only the necessary fields, we will recreate the one form and divide it into 3 forms: 
      <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
        <li>Workshop Request Form, </li>
        <li>Workshop Inquiry Form and </li>
        <li>Self-Organised Workshops Registration Form. </li>
      </ol>
  This project will impact and help our community and Member organisations as well as others interested in running Carpentries workshops. 

  The Workshop Administration Team is working on updating the process for how workshops are requested and reported. We want to make communicating with us about upcoming workshops (planned or desired) easier and efficient. Please stay tuned for more information about the progress of this update!
