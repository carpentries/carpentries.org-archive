There are lots of ways to get involved in our community and many different ways to support the work of the Carpentries. 

### Pathways for Engagement - Institutions

#### Become a Member

Institutions such as universities and research institutes can best support 
The Carpentries by becoming a <a href="../membership/">member organisation</a>. Member organisations make a commitment to the growth and spread of The Carpentries, and receive priority access to [instructor training](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_training/index.html) as well as guidance with local capacity building within their organisation. 

#### Sponsor CarpentryCon

[CarpentryCon 2018](http://www.carpentrycon.org/), our key community building event this year, will be held in Dublin from 30 May - 1 June, 2018. We are
still seeking sonsorship to make this a truly global and diverse event that both celebrates our global community and helps foster the professional development of the research leaders of the future. Can you help? [Read about what benefits sponsorship will bring.](http://www.carpentrycon.org/#portfolio)
