Teaching Carpentries [workshops]({{site.url}}/workshops/) is rewarding and builds a great skill set, whether you are working as an [Instructor](https://github.com/carpentries/commons/blob/master/text-for-instructors.md) teaching Software or Data Carpentry workshops to
learners, or working as a [Trainer](https://github.com/carpentries/commons/blob/master/text-for-trainers.md) preparing new Instructors to teach. 

All Carpentries instructors have completed [instructor training](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_training/index.html).
