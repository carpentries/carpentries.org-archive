**Serah Rono**: Hello and welcome to the first episode of The Carpentries’ new podcast. In this episode, consisting of excerpts of discussions of the two Fireside Chat sessions, during CarpentryCon @ Home 2020, we will be hearing from Toby Hodges, Naomi Penfold, Angela Li, Marlene Mhangami, and Abigail Mayes on topics related to Mindfulness & Self-Care in online communities

**Music Break**

**Serah Rono**: I want to throw a question at Toby and Naomi. So someone asked: “I would love to know how successful community managers balance their life with the work that seems to take everything that one has. How do you avoid the trap of there always being more that one could do?”

**Naomi Penfold**: Can I go first? Cool, okay. Oh, gosh. Play. Play. I have learned the hard way, as I’m sure many people have, that you cannot just work all the time and not give yourself the joy of play. So, I now do improvised comedy with a troupe in Edinburgh. It’s totally different. I don’t look at my laptop. It’s not work-related. It’s creative. There’s different people. I learned that tip from Monica Granados, who runs a product in the Open Science space, and it’s just been amazing. As good as meds for depression, honestly. It’s been amazing. So, I think that’s really important, and the other thing I’d say is boundaries. Toby role models this really well, this ability to know what you can bring, what value you offer and prioritise that for the capacity and time you have, because you cannot give yourself 100 percent to other people all the time and that’s what Community Managers like. We turn up for other people; it’s what fires us. But we just run out of fuel if you just carry on without sustaining yourself. So, I would strongly advocate that you’re not a bad person if you say no. You’re not a bad person if you say, “Not this time,” because you know what you need to do every week, every month, and what you need in order to also be a well-rounded person with friends and family and joy in your life and things like that.

**Serah Rono**: Amazing. Thank you Naomi, and Toby?

**Toby Hodges**: Yeah. So, everything Naomi said, and I can add a few things, I guess. Advice that was given to me by another Carpentries instructor recently is to actively practice saying no to people; saying, “Thanks very much for the opportunity, but I don’t have time.” Or if you don’t feel comfortable doing that, and sometimes it can be really hard to actually say no – I find it hard to say no to people to their face – at least practice saying, “Thanks very much for thinking of me. Before I commit to anything, I need to check my calendar to make sure that I don’t have any other commitments that will get in the way of this.” This is good because it gives you the time to actually go check your calendar, which is probably something that you want to do. It doesn’t do any harm, and it also gives you the time and the space if you need it, like I often do, to compose that really nicely-worded, polite email that actually says no to the person that asked you to do something. I find that a lot easier, to be honest, than saying no to them in person, in the flesh. 

I’ll also add, I think because we should talk a little bit about not only our responsibility to ourselves here, although that is very important, but also the responsibility that we have to our community members. You should remember that first of all, if you aren’t looking after yourself you’re not putting yourself in a position where you can look after the community that you’re working with. Last night on the equivalent call I gave a name check to Malvika, but she’s actually here today, so I get to wave at her. Hi, Malvika. Malvika talked relatively recently on Twitter about not only saying no to things but also being proud of yourself as a Community Manager if you’re the type of person that people feel like they can say no to as well. If you present yourself in that way to your community, you should feel proud of yourself for having done so. 
Serah Rono: So Angela Li, I have a question for you, and it’s very related to what Toby was talking about. It came from a community member and they ask “What practices or skills have you found most transformative in working with others as a community leader?”
Angela Li: This is good. I feel like I have a few that I’ve developed over time. I think one of the first ones for me is practicing gratitude on a daily basis. I think a lot of people here do that and it just helps me through the day and it helps me sort of realize how amazing my communities are. By that, reaching out to people and letting them know, like, “Hey, that was a fantastic talk you gave,” or “I really appreciated when you helped out with that one thing.” So, I don’t do it enough and I wish I did it more, but I think every time I do even just thank someone and say, “Hey, I really appreciated that,” it makes my day better; it makes their day better. So, I think that’s a fundamental practice. I’m trying to get good at it. So, sort of that praise. Making sure that you’re telling people what they’re doing well, not only “We could improve this.” And this is something that I feel took me a while to develop, because I’m always so focused on what we could do better after a successful event or launch or something. After some resource goes out, I’m like, “Man, we could have done this better,” but stepping back and doing a debrief of what went well – what was good about that? What do we want to keep in that process? Focusing on – doing a debrief of your success, not only how to improve. Making sure that’s a key part. So, I think it’s sort of two things, gratitude and debriefing your successes. And once I started doing that, I realized sometimes my successes aren’t actually – like, they’re successes in the outcome, but maybe not in the process. So, whatever came out of it might have been good, and maybe the process to get there could be improved. So, thinking about that, too.
I’m trying to think of something else. I think one final thing that I want to mention is I think listening is probably – I used to feel really nervous about open silences and would always rush to fill those silences, especially on Zoom. It just gets really awkward after a while. You don’t want to just sit there in silence. Giving myself – doing a little count to five seconds in my brain, and people who are quiet will jump in and say something. And I think really working on those listening skills, so if you could take, like, a coaching class, a class that allows you to develop those listening skills, that’s so valuable. The first thing I did as a Maintainer Community Lead, actually, was to have three or four months of just random calls with people in the community and just talk to them about what’s going well, what’s going on, what’s happening. Maybe it’s the social scientist in me, just sitting with people and being like, “So, tell me about your experience in the community? What’s happening?” And sometimes you don’t have the time for that, but if you do, it’s definitely worth the input. It’s sort of like, the ethnographic, “Tell me about your experience and tell me about what you need.” And from that, I realized there were things that I didn’t realize we needed to think about that were really important to people. So, the listening, the practicing gratitude, the debriefing your successes – those are a few things that really were transformative for me.

**Serah Rono**: And now let’s hear from Marlene on the topic of  practices or skills you have found most transformative in working with communities.

**Marlene Mhangami**: Sure. So, I think when I think of practices and skills for myself personally, I would 100 percent agree with what everyone has just said, and what Naomi said was also great as well in terms of trying to move out of the tech bubble sometimes is great – it’s a really good thing. And for me, I try to at least once a week have a day where I’m just not doing anything tech-related. I’m not doing anything work-related at all, and that’s been very helpful for me. I also try and meditate, personally. Not consistently – I’m not consistent with that, but it does help when I am consistent about it. In terms of – so, that would be for self-care, and 100 percent I would agree with Toby in terms of saying no and learning to be able to do that.
In terms of the larger, broader community and encouraging care for our community, I think for myself I have – I think a really key part of that is trying to understand the community and the needs of your specific community. I work a lot with the African Python community and also do some work with the American Python community, and they’re very different communities, very different needs. Some overlap in that, but they are very different needs for the two communities. And so, for me, I think I have tried my best to really connect with specific people in certain communities. Ask them, “Okay, what are the needs in your specific country?” For example, someone was saying that they’re from a Francophone country and we hadn’t actually been – all of our meetings had been in English and we hadn’t done anything French-related at all. So, taking in that feedback and saying, “Okay, how can we actually care for this segment of our community?” It’s very difficult to do that sometimes, but I think actively engaging with your community members is a great way to find out what they need.

**Serah Rono**: Amazing. I really like that and especially because active listening is such an underrated and important skill, and it is really important for all of us to find opportunities to cultivate it as we work with communities as we go along. Thank you so much. 
The next question is for Abigail. how can open communities begin to embrace and practice community care?

**Abigail Mayes**: I do think community care and personal care are really related, and the way I see personal care is just making sure I’m running at a pace that I can sustain long-term and just knowing that I can’t sustain a movement or a community if I’m not sustaining myself. So, starting with that and making sure I’m pacing myself properly, and everyone’s pace is different and it changes depending on what life stage you’re in, but then adapting that to the community. Helping your community pace themselves. You don’t want your community to be a flash in the pan that gets really worked up and does something for one week and then everyone burns out and has to go take a rest. Sometimes that’s what you need. You need that spurt of energy to reach something, but understand that people need to take a break afterwards. Or even when there’s a crisis, understanding that people might need to step away from this project for a while and that’s okay, but they might need to rally together. So, just understand the pacing of your community and make sure people aren’t going too hard, and check in with people. I just love all of these suggestions about the coworking and leaning on community and leaning on others. Make sure you’re actually asking people how they’re doing and do regular check-ins and see, like, are people still finding joy in this work or is this becoming a real burden?

And then, to really help with that, I find it makes a big difference if you can structure the way people interact with your community so that it’s okay for them to step away for a little while and come back and there’s no shame in that. Just make it okay for people to step in and out whenever they can. That usually shows that you care about them and gives them permission to take a few months out if it’s been really rough. And I think we’re seeing this now with so much going on in the world. People really need to take a step back, and making that okay and not shaming people for that.

**Serah Rono**: Amazing. Thank you so much Abby. Thank you for listening to the pilot episode of our new podcast. Next week we will publish excerpts from the discussions on Equity & Inclusion also discussed at CarpentryCon @ Home 2020.
