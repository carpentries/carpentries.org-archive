The Assessment Network was established as a space for those working on assessment within the open source/research computing community to collaborate and share resources.

## Assessment Network Goals
The goals of the assessment network include:
+ Comparing assessment efforts across various programs.
+ Discussing strategies for measuring and assessing research computing productivity.
+ Managing and sharing resources (quantitative/qualitative tools and approaches) across countries.

[Webinar with Rochelle Tractenberg: Debrief](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2018/03/tractenberg-summary.html)

On February 2, 2018, the [Assessment Network](https://carpentries.org/assessment-network/) held a webinar with Dr. Rochelle Tractenberg of Georgetown University. Our starting point was the controversy about short-format training which arose last year, following the publication of a 2017 _PNAS_ paper titled ["Null effects of boot camps and short-format training for PhD students in life sciences"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5604013/). The Carpentries design and deliver short-format training for working with software and data; trainees are researchers from various fields. The Carpentries’ [initial response](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/12/response-null-effects.html) to the paper discussed many ways in which we have been successful with respect to our goals for Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry workshops. However, given that short-format training is a known challenge for generating sustainable content learning, we hoped that Dr. Tractenberg’s expertise might shed some light on areas with room for improvement.
