title: Help Wanted Issues
---

The table below lists all lessons labelled "Help wanted" and/or
"good first issue" on many of our repositories and lesson repositories
in The Carpentries Incubator.
We hope it will help you find opportunities to contribute to Carpentries
lessons and projects.
The table can be sorted and filtered based on the contents of its columns:
click on a heading cell to sort the rows by that column,
or type a term into the box included in a header cell to filter the table rows by
cells in that column which contain that term.

If you are a Maintainer and would like to include issues
from your lesson repository in this table,
please read the
[Information for Lesson Maintainers](#information-for-lesson-maintainers)
at the end of the page.
