The Carpentries project comprises <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a> 
and <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/">Data Carpentry</a>, communities of Instructors, Trainers, Maintainers, 
helpers, and supporters who share a mission to teach foundational computational and data science skills to researchers. 
The Carpentries subscribes to a shared <a href="http://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>. In January, 2018, Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry merged their projects to form <strong>The Carpentries</strong>. 

You can donate to The Carpentries <a href="https://carpentries.wedid.it/">through this portal</a>.

<h4>How is The Carpentries Managed?</h4>

The Carpentries is a fiscally sponsored project of <a href="http://communityin.org/">Community Initiatives</a>, 
a registered 501(c)3 non-profit based in California, USA. Tracy Teal is the Executive Director, and governance of the merged Carpentries is undertaken 
by an <a href="{{site.url}}/governance">Executive Council</a> which comprises 
four community-elected members and five appointed members drawn from 
the previous Steering Committees of Software and Data Carpentry.

<h4>What Information is Where?</h4>

What is common across both Carpentries - the Code of Conduct, assessment, governance, instructor training, our privacy policy - will be found through this site, while Software or Data Carpentry-specific material, such as lessons, will remain on the individual [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) sites. We will increasingly post on the Carpentries [blog]({{site.url}}/blog/), rather than to individual Carpentries blog sites. 

<h4>What is a Carpentries Workshop?</h4>

<a href="https://software-carpentry.org/workshops/">Software Carpentry</a> workshops 
or <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/workshops/">Data Carpentry</a> workshops generally 
comprise two full days of face-to-face instruction, based on 
either <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/lessons">Software Carpentry</a> 
or <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons">Data Carpentry</a> lesson materials, respectively. 

Workshops are taught by volunteer Instructors. Certified Instructors comprise people who 
have completed our <a href="http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/">instructor training</a> course. 
<a href="https://software-carpentry.org/lessons">Software Carpentry</a> 
and <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons">Data Carpentry</a> lessons are all 
open source, and are hosted on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.

<h4>Style</h4>

The Carpentries, while sounding plural, is a singular entity. Therefore, when referring to The Carpentries, verbs should also be singular, e.g. *'The Carpentries is ...'*. The correct title for the merged organisation is **The Carpentries**. However, you can use terminology such as *'A Carpentries workshop ...'*.
