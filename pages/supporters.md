We are grateful to our supporters who help us reach the [mission and vision](({% link pages/about.md %})) of The Carpentries. These include our [Member Organisations](({% link pages/members.md %})) and those who sponsor [workshops](({% link pages/workshops.md %})) as well as grants and donations. We are in a position to create positive change in the data and software communities and our supporters help us in this endeavor.

We aim to be transparent in our sources of revenue and how they align with our vision and values. Funding must support existing priorities. Towards this aim we share our sources of grants and donations and the work they are funding. We consistently work to keep this page up to date, but if you are aware of sources of funding that are not listed please [let us know](mailto:team@carpentries.org).
