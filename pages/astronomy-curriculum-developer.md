Posting date: 26 December 2019 

**This position has now been filled.**

**Background**

As datasets in astronomy grow larger and more complex, data analysis and visualization are essential for astronomical research, 
yet there are few opportunities for astronomers to become experts in data-intensive skills. [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) 
(formerly Software and Data Carpentry) have a long history of training scientists in foundational computational and data science skills. 
The Astronomy Curriculum Development Committee (ACDC) has received funding from the American Institute of Physics through the American 
Astronomical Society to support the development of a data science curriculum for Astronomy. The Carpentries is seeking a six-month 
part-time curriculum developer (20 hours per week) to work alongside the ACDC to create open-source Data Carpentry lessons for 
astronomy in advanced Python, data management, and data visualization. 

**Scope of Work**

The successful candidate will be managed by The Carpentries staff and work closely with the ACDC to develop 3-4 self-contained 
Carpentries-style [lessons](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/) on predefined topics of data organization, data management, 
interactive data visualization, and publishing data for longevity and interactivity. The lesson development process will be 
supported by regular reviews by the ACDC via remote meetings and GitHub project management tools. The lesson developer will 
present the completed lessons for community review and incorporate feedback. There is the possibility for the lesson developer 
to teach the lessons at a future national meeting of the American Astronomical Society.

**Qualifications**

**Required:**
- Certified Carpentries instructor or similar teaching certification
- Familiarity with or desire to learn Bokeh or similar Python interactive visualization (e.g., Altair)
- Familiarity with astronomical concepts equivalent to that gained from an undergraduate degree in astronomy
- Able to teach advanced topics in Python (e.g., classes and scientific packages such as Pandas and Astropy)
- Experience working with Git and using open source features of GitHub (e.g., issues, reviewing, pull requests)
- Excellent written and real-time communication skills 

**Preferred:**
- Knowledge of astronomical datasets (e.g., Vizier hosted catalogs)
- Familiarity with or desire to learn cloud application platforms (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Azure)
- Experience teaching Carpentries workshops or similar 
- Curriculum development experience (ideally collaborative)
- Experience with reproducible science

We have [a large community](https://carpentries.org/instructors-map/) of instructors and contributors, and a much larger community of users. We use evidence-based teaching practices to teach the core skills for effective computational and data work, and we promote reproducible research and open science/open source widely. All interactions in The Carpentries community and spaces, both virtual and in-person, are governed by our [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html#code-of-conduct-detailed-view).

We represent the intersection of astronomers, statisticians, and educators who together recognize the rising importance of data skills to the astronomical community and the scarcity of training resources. We are committed to working with the astronomical community to meet this need with the development of a two-day Data Carpentry workshop curriculum.

**Compensation**  

This is a remote position with The Carpentries fiscal sponsor, [Community Initiatives](http://communityin.org/). Compensation will be USD $20-40/hr, dependent on experience.
