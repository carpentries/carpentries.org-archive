**The Lesson Infrastructure Committee went into hiatus in March 2020 due to the pandemic and is not currently active. Read more in this blog post: [The Lesson Infrastructure Commitee: Past, Present, and Future](https://carpentries.org/blog/2021/12/lesson-infrastructure-committee/).**

Members of the Lesson Infrastructure Committee served as Maintainers for The Carpentries lesson template and its documentation, 
as well as for The Carpentries workshop template.

_Our Goal:_    
To maintain and update lesson and workshop templates for The Carpentries.

_Our Approach:_    
We did this by conducting meetings where we reviewed current issues and plan updates. Minutes and other information are stored in 
this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/carpentries/lesson-infrastructure).

_Our Structure:_    
We held monthly meetings. See our [etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/infrastructure-subcommittee) for meeting times and agenda items.
