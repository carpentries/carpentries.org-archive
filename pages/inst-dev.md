excerpt: The Instructor Development Committee helps new and established Instructors.
---

The Instructor Development Committee (formerly known as the Mentoring Committee) supports Instructors as they progress 
through training, teaching, curriculum development,
and other community-related activities. They help promote community-building and networking, by 
providing virtual spaces where instructors from all over the world can share teaching success stories and 
discuss teaching strategies. For more about our work, see our [onboarding document](https://github.com/carpentries/mentoring/blob/master/onboarding-document.md).

The Committee also organises and oversees the work of Mentoring Groups. These groups support instructors in a variety of ways. 
Whether you are a new instructor preparing to teach your first workshop, a seasoned instructor hoping to launch workshops in 
a new community, or an instructor excited about getting involved with lesson development and maintenance, mentoring groups 
will help you gain the confidence, technical skills, and teaching skills you need to reach your goal.

_Our Goal:_    
To support Instructors in our community through a range of activities. 

_Our Approach:_    
We run regular [instructor discussion sessions](https://pad.carpentries.org/instructor-discussion) where people preparing to teach can ask for advice. People who have recently taught
can use the sessions to debrief.


_Our Structure:_    
The Committee has monthly meetings, which are open to new members. Meetings are scheduled, organised, and 
run through this [etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/scf-mentoring).
For more about committee roles, see the [Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/mentoring/mentoring-subcommittee-roles.html). We also organise information about our work though this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/carpentries/mentoring).

_Our Leadership:_    
There are two co-Chairs. Toby Hodges is one of the current co-Chairs. The other co-Chair position is vacant.
In addition, a Carpentries staff member is part of the committee as a staff liaison.
