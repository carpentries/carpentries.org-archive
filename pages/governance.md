Governance of The Carpentries is undertaken by the **Executive Council**, to whom the Executive Director reports. The Council comprises nine members, from The Carpentries community or others, four elected by the community, and five appointed from the Executive Council.

## Roles and Responsibilities of the Executive Council

The Carpentries Executive Council is the highest leadership body of The Carpentries project. It is responsible for strategic and organisational planning, selecting the Executive Director and evaluating their performance, financial oversight, identifying revenue streams and resource development, approving and monitoring The Carpentries programs and services, and enhancing The Carpentries public image. Members of the council also serve as advocates and ambassadors for the organisation, leveraging their networks to benefit the project’s reputation and fundraising. The Executive Council executes these responsibilities through a combination of monthly Executive Council meetings and regular correspondence and collaboration via email and online platforms.

## What is the Executive Council working on?

In addition to [publicly posting meeting minutes](https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info/tree/master/minutes), the Executive Council reports on its activities periodically in [Carpentry Clippings](https://carpentries.org/newsletter/) (the organizational newsletter) as well as through [blog posts](https://carpentries.org/posts-by-tags/#blog-tag-governance).
The council also prepares [Yearly Summaries](https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info/tree/master/year-in-review) of its activities.
