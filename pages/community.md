The Carpentries works to help institutions and individuals spread skills for data analysis, computational thinking, 
and research software development through building local and global communities of practice.

## We do this through:

* Overseeing the training and certification of [Instructors](#instructors)
* Maintaining global communities of practice:
	* [Mentors](#mentoring) - those who support Instructors as they build their skills
	* [Trainers](#trainers) - those who prepare our new Instructors
	* Lesson developers - those who create new lessons
	* [Curriculum advisors](#curriculum-advisors) - those who guide development of existing lessons
	* [Lesson maintainers](#maintainers) - those who support existing lessons
	* [Lesson infrastructure](#lesson-infrastructure) - those who support lesson building and styling
	* [Assessment](#assessment-network) - those who help us understand our impact
	* [Champions](#champions) - those who work to spread our impact locally
	* Infrastructure - those who work to support our infrastructure
	* [Workshop administrators](#workshop-administrators) - those who coordinate workshops regionally
	* [Code of conduct](#code-of-conduct-committee) - those who keep our community friendly and welcoming

* Supporting regional communities of practice:
	* [Carpentries en Latinoamérica](#carpentries-en-latinoamérica) - building Carpentry community in Latin America
	* [African Task Force](#african-task-force) - building Carpentry community in Africa

* Keeping our community strong and connected through meetups (virtual and in-person) and interest-specific mailing lists
    * [CarpentryCon](#carpentry-con) - our annual in-person meetup for our global community
    * [Community calendar](#community-events)
    * [Networking opportunities](#network)
    * [Mailing lists](#mailing-lists)


### Instructors
Carpentry Instructors are the core of our community. Instructors organise and teach Carpentry workshops to spread data literacy and programmatic skills both locally and globally. Members of our Instructor community work together to actively grow their instructional and technical skills. Becoming an Instructor is a great step to leveling-up your own technical skills and helps you to become a more effective technical communicator. 

* [Training materials](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/)
* [Instructor training curriculum](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/)
* [Apply to become an Instructor](https://amy.software-carpentry.org/forms/request_training/)! To direct your application to our Open Instructor Training pool, leave the "group" category blank. Open training applications are reviewed periodically and ranked based on free text responses, with bonus points available for demographic, geographic, and domain criteria outlined [here](https://github.com/carpentries/instructor-training/blob/gh-pages/files/rubric.md). Applicants are then invited to join online training events as seats become available.
* For more information contact [Erin Becker](mailto:ebecker@carpentries.org).

### Mentoring

Mentoring is how our global instructors come together to support each other and develop new teaching and 
technical skills. We create an open and inviting environment through Instructor discussion sessions and 
project-based small mentorship groups.

#### Mentoring Groups

Mentoring Groups support instructors in a variety of ways. Whether you are a new instructor preparing to teach your first workshop, a seasoned instructor hoping to launch workshops in a new community, or an instructor excited about getting involved with lesson development and maintenance, mentoring groups will help you gain the confidence, technical skills, and teaching skills you need to reach your goal.
