### Executive Council

Governance of The Carpentries is undertaken by the Executive Council, to whom the Executive Director reports. The Council comprises nine members, from The Carpentries community or others, four elected by the community, and five appointed from the Executive Council.

The Carpentries Executive Council is the highest leadership body of The Carpentries project. It is responsible for strategic and organisational planning, selecting the Executive Director and evaluating their performance, financial oversight, identifying revenue streams and resource development, approving and monitoring The Carpentries programs and services, and enhancing The Carpentries public image. Members of the council also serve as advocates and ambassadors for the organisation, leveraging their networks to benefit the project’s reputation and fundraising. The Executive Council executes these responsibilities through a combination of monthly Executive Council meetings and regular correspondence and collaboration via email and online platforms.

More information about the Executive Council and current members is available on [the Governance page](https://carpentries.org/governance/).


### Instructors
Carpentry Instructors are the core of our community. Instructors organise and teach Carpentry workshops to spread data literacy and programmatic skills both locally and globally. Members of our Instructor community work together to actively grow their instructional and technical skills. Becoming an Instructor is a great step to leveling-up your own technical skills and helps you to become a more effective technical communicator.

* [Instructor training curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/)
* [Apply to become an Instructor](https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/request_training/)! To direct your application to our Open Instructor Training pool, leave the "group" category blank. Open training applications are reviewed periodically and ranked based on free text responses, with bonus points available for [demographic, geographic, and domain criteria outlined here](https://github.com/carpentries/instructor-training/blob/gh-pages/files/rubric.md). Applicants are then invited to join online training events as seats become available.
* [Update](https://amy.carpentries.org/dashboard/trainee/autoupdate_profile/) your instructor profile
* For more information, contact [Erin Becker](mailto:ebecker@carpentries.org).

### Instructor Development

Instructor development is how our global instructors come together to support each other and develop new teaching and
technical skills. We create an open and inviting environment through community discussions and project-based small group mentoring.

#### Mentoring Groups

Mentoring Groups support instructors in a variety of ways. Whether you are a new instructor preparing to teach your first workshop, a seasoned instructor hoping to launch workshops in a new community, or an instructor excited about getting involved with lesson development and maintenance, mentoring groups will help you gain the confidence, technical skills, and teaching skills you need to reach your goal.

These lessons are not officially endorsed by The Carpentries. Read [more information](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/proposals/blob/master/README.md) about contributing to The Carpentries Incubator.

[The Carpentries Lab](/community-lessons/#the-carpentrieslab) is for sharing peer-reviewed lessons, vetted by the The Carpentries. We are not currently accepting submissions for these lessons.

Those looking for ways to contribute to existing lesson material can find
a list of issues in need of attention on the [Help Wanted page](/help-wanted-issues/).

### CarpentryCon

The Carpentries hosts CarpentryCon, a community-organised meeting for our global community. [CarpentryCon 2018](http://www.carpentrycon.org/) was held from 30 May to 1 June in Dublin, Ireland. [An online, seven-week CarpentryCon @ Home](http://2020.carpentrycon.org) was held between July and August 2020. Both conferences were a great success. If you are interested in helping to organise the next CarpentryCon, contact [The Carpentries](mailto:{{site.contact}}).

A global CarpentryCon will be held every two years, with locally organised CarpentryConnect events held in the off years.

### CarpentryConnects

CarpentryConnects are community convenings, organised to bring together community members of The Carpentries that are in close proximity geographically for knowledge exchange, collaboration, and networking. [The CarpentryConnect Planning Kit](https://carpentryconnect.org) provides checklists, templates, recommendations for best practices and resources to serve as guides in planning and carrying out CarpentryConnect events.

Here is a list of all CarpentryConnect events held in the past: [carpentryconnect.org/case-studies/](https://carpentryconnect.org/case-studies/)
