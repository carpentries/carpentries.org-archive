### Instructors
Carpentry Instructors are the core of our community. Instructors organise and teach Carpentry workshops to spread data literacy and programmatic skills both locally and globally. Members of our Instructor community work together to actively grow their instructional and technical skills. Becoming an Instructor is a great step to leveling-up your own technical skills and helps you to become a more effective technical communicator.

* [Instructor training curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/)
* [Apply to become an Instructor](https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/request_training/)! To direct your application to our Open Instructor Training pool, leave the "group" category blank. Open training applications are reviewed periodically and ranked based on free text responses, with bonus points available for [demographic, geographic, and domain criteria outlined here](https://github.com/carpentries/instructor-training/blob/gh-pages/files/rubric.md). Applicants are then invited to join online training events as seats become available.

### Instructor Development

Instructor development is how our global instructors come together to support each other and develop new teaching and
technical skills. We create an open and inviting environment through community discussions and project-based small group mentoring.

#### Mentoring Groups

Mentoring Groups support instructors in a variety of ways. Whether you are a new instructor preparing to teach your first workshop, a seasoned instructor hoping to launch workshops in a new community, or an instructor excited about getting involved with lesson development and maintenance, mentoring groups will help you gain the confidence, technical skills, and teaching skills you need to reach your goal.

### Lesson Developers

The Carpentries community is commited to a collaborative and open process for lesson development and to sharing teaching materials. We provide two avenues for community members to share lesson materials.

[The Carpentries Incubator](/community-lessons/#the-carpentries-incubator) is for Carpentries community members to share Carpentries-style teaching materials at all stages of development, to receive feedback from other community members. These lessons are not officially endorsed by The Carpentries. Read [more information](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/proposals/blob/master/README.md) about contributing to The Carpentries Incubator.

[The CarpentriesLab](/community-lessons/#the-carpentrieslab) is for sharing peer-reviewed lessons, vetted by the The Carpentries. We are not currently accepting submissions for these lessons.

Those looking for ways to contribute to existing lesson material can find
a list of issues in need of attention on the [Help Wanted page](/help-wanted-issues/).
